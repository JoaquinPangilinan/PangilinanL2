                <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teenage Years:</h3>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entering my teenage years, I was excited because I was getting more freedom
                than I had when I was in elementary school.<sup><b>1</b></sup> Thus, in my early teenage years, it was hard
                for me to make friends.<sup><b>2</b></sup> I was shy and scared to be judged.<sup><b>3</b></sup> Nevertheless, it went okay.<sup><b>4</b></sup>
                I found friends that I still have to this day, and I know that I’ll have them for the rest of
                my life.<sup><b>5</b></sup> High school was fun and all, but it can also be hectic as there was a lot of issues
                lingering and students’ where I studied had high egos.<sup><b>6</b></sup> Although it was fun and all, I also
                had my downfalls.<sup><b>7</b></sup> Just like my elementary days, I also got into a lot of trouble due to
                personal reasons.<sup><b>8</b></sup> Since my mom was working abroad by this time, my dad got called a
                lot again for the troubles that had come my way.<sup><b>9</b></sup> Even though there were times that I
                was wrong, my dad always saw the right thing in me.<sup><b>10</b></sup> Don’t be mistaken, I got scolded
                but my dad talked to me calmly and always told me to try to be better.<sup><b>11</b></sup> During my
                teenage, years I’ve discovered a lot of things that I didn’t knew I had in me.<sup><b>12</b></sup> I’ve done
                things that I will carry for the rest of my life.<sup><b>13</b></sup> During my teenage years I also realized how
                strong I am as a person to be able to go through those difficult times and to try and
                always look on the brighter side.<sup><b>14</b></sup> Being a teenager, my curiosity led to a lot of experiences,
                some bad and some good.<sup><b>15</b></sup> As a teenager, I learned how to drink, how to smoke, and
                how to vape even though it was wrong, I found peace doing such things.<sup><b>16</b></sup> When my dad
                found out that I already knew how to drink he didn’t get mad.<sup><b>17</b></sup> He taught me how to carry
                myself if ever I drank outside our premises, and he taught me to always protect myself
                when I am in such places.<sup><b>18</b></sup> My teenage years were full of ups and downs, but it was full
                of learnings.<sup><b>19</b></sup> I will never regret every experience and mistakes that came down on my
                path.<sup><b>20</b></sup><br></br>
