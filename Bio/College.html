                <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;College Years:</h3>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then adulthood came.<sup><b>1</b></sup> I learned to drive and to handle things that I didn’t realize that I’d be facing at an early stage.<sup><b>2</b></sup> 
                And learning that new skill of mine helped me cope up with the challenges that came.<sup><b>3</b></sup> I admit, becoming a young adult is not easy.<sup><b>4</b></sup> 
                When I entered my adulthood, it struck me.<sup><b>5</b></sup> I realized that this is the time that I should focus on being able to have a secure future.<sup><b>6</b></sup> 
                I was scared because I wasn’t sure yet about what career path I should take.<sup><b>7</b></sup> I realized that becoming an adult comes with responsibilities that you should be 
                strong enough to survive.<sup><b>8</b></sup> But then I knew I was strong enough to handle the odds that I may face.<sup><b>9</b></sup> I suddenly believed the saying 
                “Shit happens” because it really does.<sup><b>10</b></sup> There were a lot of tough times that I and my family faced, and I knew I had to be strong for myself and my siblings 
                because all we have is each other.<sup><b>11</b></sup> Entering adulthood without knowing what career I really want was the only thing that gave me a tough time.<sup><b>12</b></sup> 
                But then, life goes on.<sup><b>13</b></sup> I researched and I decided to enroll as an IT student.<sup><b>14</b></sup> It was hard for me to love this program, but I had no other 
                choice.<sup><b>15</b></sup> Having said that, I do side hustles to provide for myself sometimes and it’s something that I enjoy doing when there’s no classes.<sup><b>16</b></sup> 
                Yes, it is hard at times but if I’m happy I don’t mind doing it.<sup><b>17</b></sup> I know that my story is full of ups and downs, but I know that makes me who I am.<sup><b>18</b></sup> 
                Adulting is hard but it’s where more opportunities could open for me.<sup><b>19</b></sup> Adulting is confusing but I just needed to find what I want and who am I doing it for.<sup><b>20</b></sup><br><br>
