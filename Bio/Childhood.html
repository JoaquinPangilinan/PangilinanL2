            <p> <blockquote>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello, everyone!<sup><b>1</b></sup> I am Myles Joaquin T. Pangilinan.<sup><b>2</b></sup> I am a 20-year-old IT student
                from the University of the East-Manila. <sup><b>3</b></sup> I was born and raised in Quezon City and my
                childhood was colorful. <sup><b>4</b></sup> I am blessed enough to be able to live with both of my parents
                under the same roof and to be guided by them. <sup><b>5</b></sup>  Being able to grow around my family has
                taught me a lot of things, it taught me how to love, how to be strong, and how to not
                give up. <sup><b>6</b></sup> Being around with my uncles, cousins, and auntie made me the person that I
                am today, and I wouldn’t change one bit of my childhood. <sup><b>7</b></sup> Looking back at my childhood
                made me realize how simple life was and how much I want to go back. <sup><b>8</b></sup>  Riding bikes and
                playing with my friends is all that I cared about. <sup><b>9</b></sup> I remember that we were not allowed to
                go outside until 4pm as it was still hot and every time, we tried to sneak out we always
                got scolded by our parents.<sup><b>10</b></sup> My friends were also a big part of my life as they taught me
                how to handle myself outside our home and taught me how to socialize.<sup><b>11</b></sup> As a child, I
                always thought of myself as playful as I always try to make everyone around me laugh.<sup><b>12</b></sup>
                Another thing about me is I am an overprotective brother; my sister tends to get irritated
                because of it but I guess that’s just how I was raised by my dad.<sup><b>13</b></sup> But of course, as I was
                just a kid, there were times that I’ve done things that would’ve got me in trouble if my
                parents found out.<sup><b>14</b></sup> I was a stubborn kid as I used to ring the doorbells of other people’s
                houses and run with my friends.<sup><b>15</b></sup> Although it was wrong, it brought joy and laughter to
                us.<sup><b>16</b></sup> I also got into a lot of fights in my elementary days because of petty things. .<sup><b>17</b></sup> My
                parents got a lot of calls from my school because of my behavior but I have no regrets
                because it was something that I had to go through to be a better person.<sup><b>18</b></sup> I had a lot of
                dreams as a child and the one dream that I will do my best to achieve is to be able to
                help my family.<sup><b>19</b></sup>  As I entered my teenage years, everything changed because my
                childhood friends also needed to live their own lives.<sup><b>20</b></sup> <br></br>
