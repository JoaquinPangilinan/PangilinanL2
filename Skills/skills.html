          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A skill that I have been hiding my whole life is that I know how to sing.<sup><b>1</b></sup> I discovered that I can sing when it was still pandemic. <sup><b>2</b></sup> 
          I started to sing while I was taking a bath, slowly I realized the basics and techniques of how to sing.<sup><b>3</b></sup> Another skill that I am really good at is driving cars and motorcycle.<sup><b>4</b></sup> 
          My father taught me how to drive a motorcycle when I was 8 years old.<sup><b>5</b></sup> Eversince that day, something in me sparked.<sup><b>6</b></sup> I thought that my only interest was with cars but 
          eventually I also realized how much I love motorcycles.<sup><b>7</b></sup> Having said that, I learned to drive a car when I was 14 years old.<sup><b>8</b></sup> Learning to drive both cars and motorcycles is
          a skill that I am blessed enough to have.<sup><b>9</b></sup> I am thankful to have such privilege and I am happy that I can help my family in some ways.<sup><b>10</b></sup> Maintaining the motorcycle I use daily
          is another skill that I have.<sup><b>11</b></sup> I myself, do basic maintenance for my motorcycle and also help my relatives that are in need of basic maintenance.<sup><b>12</b></sup> Having some knowledge of what to 
          do incase of unexpected circumstances on the road is something that I am prepared for.<sup><b>13</b></sup> Another hidden skill that I have is playing
          the guitar.<sup><b>14</b></sup> When I am bored, I play guitar and I just try to make my own versions of the songs that I like.<sup><b>15</b></sup> That said,
          being able to play the guitar brought me and my family closer as it served as our bonding.<sup><b>16</b></sup> Another skill that I have is am somewhat an athlete.<sup><b>17</b></sup> I have previously participated in basketball leagues
          and volleyball leagues.<sup><b>18</b></sup> Also, I won the MVP for volleyball in our intramurals before while wearing vans.<sup><b>19</b></sup> Lastly, basic trouble shooting of gadgets is something that I do.<sup><b>20</b></sup>
